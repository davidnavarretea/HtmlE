# `05` Create anchor or link

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Add to the website body an anchor tag that says `Click me to search on google`

The anchor should takes the user to the url [http://google.com](http://google.com) when clicked.

## 💡 Hint:

+ The given url is an ABSOLUTE path because it starts with "http", that means that you are telling the browser that you are going to be taking the user OUTSIDE of your website.

+ Read about absolute vs relative paths here: http://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/
