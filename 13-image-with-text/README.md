# `13` Image with Text

Before CSS existed, using tables was the only way possible to do some website layouts, is a very similar process to creating layouts on MS Office.

For example, to recreate this example you have to do the following:

1. Create a table with the attribute `border="0"`.

2. Add row (`tr`) with 2 columns (`td`) inside.

3. The first column has to contain an image with the attribute `height="150"`. 

4. The second one with the attribute `valign="top"` to move the text to the top of the cell and also add some text inside: you can use this tool to generate fake text that looks like real text: http://www.lipsum.com/
  
## üìù Instructions: 

1. Please follow the previous steps to recreate the example.
