		<p>Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read</p>
		<p>Then you can quote someone to add credibility:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<strong>
				A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble<br />
				of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business<br />
				-A.A. Milne, If I May
			</strong>
		</blockquote>

			Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new<br />
			generations have this things in common:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
			<li>Have the spawn of attention of a bird.</li>
			<li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.</li>
		</ul>
